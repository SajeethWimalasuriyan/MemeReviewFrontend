# MemeReview


## Description:

Meme Review is a social media platform that is centered around memes and rating them. A user can view global posts and the most popular memes. Once a user is logged in they can post, comment and rate other memes. The front-end is built with React, Redux, Bootstrap, and Material-UI. I also created a custom backend API using ExpressJS, Firebase Realtime Database, and Firebase Functions. Finally, the Imgflip API (RESTful/JSON interface) was used to get blank meme templates that are trending worldwide.

## Project Status:

This side project is not complete. Features such as being able to upload photos and edit memes directly in the web app need to be added, but as of right now the minimum viable product is complete.
